# A Groyse Metziye Museum

This project was built with React.js for a sweet little museum, that shows how people used to live 100 years ago. The project includes a homepage route, a gallery route, a questions and answers route and an admin route. The animation in this project was made with [framer-motion][framer-motion] and with [react-intersection-observer][react-intersection-observer] libraries. I adjusted the site to different screen sizes with [react-responsive][react-responsive] library. The backend of this project (where the admin can change the price of the entrance fee and the Whatsapp link) was built on Google's [Firestore database and with Firebase Auth][Firestore database and with Firebase Auth]. The site itself was deployed on Google's Firebase Hosting service.
